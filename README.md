This is the repository to hold the code to build _Pyramid on my Roof_, the fiction novel by Ram Iyer.

### Adding new files

New files have to be of the `Rmd` format, and must be added to the `bookfiles` directory.

### Building the book

The book has to be built using `bookdown`. _RStudio_ can also be used to accomplish this.
